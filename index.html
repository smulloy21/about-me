	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, though my background is in philosophy, languages and literature. I'm leaving a PhD program to learn to code and start a new career, and I'm excited to see where it takes me!</p>

	  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
	  <p>I'm currently living in Madison, WI, but I'm from the east coast originally. My dad was in the Navy, and then became a businessman, so I was raised to approach things logically and practically, and to always be fair and honest.<p>
	  <p>I graduated in 2011 from St. John's College, where I studied philosophy and literature. After St. John's I lived in Moscow for a year to learn Russian, and was then accepted into a Slavic graduate program. I've just completed my first year, and I've decided to leave the program and put my linguistic skills to use by applying them to web development.</p>

	  <h2>More About Me</h2>
	  <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
	  <p>I enjoy playing ice hockey, watching American football, reading and discussing literature, and now, coding!</p>
	  <h4>What's your dream job?</h4>
	  <p>My deam job would probably be working at a start-up, building something that could really make an impact.</p>
	  <h4>What's your coding background?</h4>
	  <p>My coding experience is almost non-existant; I've spend a few weeks following tutorials online and that's it. I've realized though, that coding is essentially applied linguistics, and so far it's going well and I'm really enjoying it.</p>
	  <h4>What have you been listening to lately?</h4>
	  <p>I actually don't listen to music that much, just whatever comes on the radio when I'm in the car. Lately, I've been re-reading Gulliver's Travels.</p>
